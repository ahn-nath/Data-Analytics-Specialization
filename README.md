# Data analytics specialization
## _freeCodeCamp_

In the Data Analysis with Python Certification, I learned the fundamentals of data analysis with Python. It covered how to read data from sources like CSVs and SQL, and how to use libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to process and visualize data. The folder contains some of thje projects I completes to demonstrate my understanding of data analysis with Python:

- [Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator](mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator).
- [Demographic Data Analyzer](demographic-data-analyzer).
- [Medical Data Visualizer](medical-data-visualizer).
- [Page View Time Series Visualizer](page-view-time-series-visualizer).

> The future is not laid out on a track. It is something that we can decide, and to the extent that we do not violate any known laws of the universe, we can probably make it work the way that we want to.

## Tech

Relevant tools:

- [Python] - an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language.
- [Jupyter Notebook] - open Source tool that allows to create and share documents that contain live code.
- [PAWS] - a Jupyter notebooks deployment hosted by Wikimedia.
